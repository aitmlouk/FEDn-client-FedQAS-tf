                Machine reading comprehension (MRC) of text data is one important task in Natural Language Understanding.
                It is a complex NLP problem with a lot of ongoing research since the release of the Stanford Question Answering
                Dataset (SQuAD) and CoQA. It is considered as an effort to teach computers how to "understand" a text, and then
                to be able to answer questions from it using deep learning. However, until now large-scale training on private
                text data and knowledge sharing has been missing for this NLP task. In this paper, we present FedQAS,
                a privacy-preserving machine reading system that leverages large-scale private data. The proposed approach
                combines Transformer models and Federated learning technologies. The system is developed using the FEDn
                framework and deployed as an alliance initiative. The proposed approach can be useful for industries
                seeking similar solutions and especially where the data are private and cannot be shared. There are a
                variety of real-world use-cases for this, ranging from assisting educational technology to
                information retrieval. The system is flexible, language-agnostic, and allows intuitive participation
                and execution of local model training. Furthermore, evaluation and application cases on the SQUAD
                dataset are provided to showcase how it overcomes data privacy issues and enables knowledge
                sharing between alliance members in a Federated learning setting.
